    <h1>Section 1: What is readable code?</h1>
<blockquote class="fragment">“You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected.” - Ward Cunningham</blockquote>

    <h1>Key idea</h1>
    Code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it.

    <p>Take a typical colleague and measure how much time it took her to read and understand the code.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Understand = she can make changes to it, spot bugs, and understand how it interacts with the rest of the system.</p>
    <h1 class="fragment">Your job is to minimize this time</h1>
